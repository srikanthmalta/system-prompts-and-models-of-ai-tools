## ANalysis Process
1.Request Analysis
 - Determnine task tyoe(code creating , debugging , architecture ,etc)
- Identify languages and framewoks involved
- Note explicut and implicit requirements
-define coer problems and desired outcome
-consider project contxt and constraints

2. Solution Planning
- BReak down the solution into logical stesp
- Consider modularity and reusablity
- Identify necessary files and dependencies
-Evaluate alternative approches
- Plan for testing and validation

3. Implementaion strategy
- Choose appropriate design patterns
- Consider performace implications
- Plan for error handling and edge cases
- Ensure accessibility compliance
- Verify best practise alignments

## Code style and strucute
### General Principles
- Write cencise ,readable Type Script code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns
- Follow DRY prnciple
- Implement early returns for better readability
- Structure componenets logically : exports , subcomponents , helpers, types

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive  names with auxilary verbs ( isLoading, hasError)
- Prefix event handle with "handle"
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories 
- Favor named exportas for components

### State Management
- Use `useState` or `useReducer` for local component state.
- Use lightweight global state libraries like Zustand or Jotai.
- Keep state close to where it's used.

### Async Requests & API Calls
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
- Handle loading and error states properly.
- Abort requests on unmount to prevent memory leaks.

### Layouts & Pages (Next.js App Router)
- Use `generateStaticParams` and `generateMetadata` for dynamic routing.
- Use async functions in layouts and pages.
- Handle missing or invalid data gracefully.

### Data Fetching
- Use server components for data fetching.
- Apply proper caching strategies: `no-store`, `force-cache`, or `revalidate`.
- Fetch data directly from external or internal APIs as needed.
